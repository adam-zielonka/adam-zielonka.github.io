## History

### Beginning - Static Website

In June 2017, my friend show me his website and after I sew, I realized that I want have the own website. So I copied his website, and rebuild for myself:

But creating the same website like friend isn't fair to the friend, so I rewrite again. My idea was to create website that looks like terminal.

### React - Interaction Website

In March 2019, I decided to move website React.js and I did it. Static website was put in noscript section. Yea. But it wasn't very good code to edit, so page look very similar to the static website. One different was animation, but it think it is possible to get the same effect using css.

In August 2019, I had the breakdown. I rewrite the terminal code, that me allow to add interaction.
